Project Title: Autism Helpdesk
Currently, there is no real data, in particular, needs assessment data to support our efforts stating the needs of 
individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families residing in Northeast Florida. We provide various 
resource materials needed to help those serve individuals with autism. MS4A need a system that will collect this data 
for a needs assessment survey and provide the one-stop online access to help individuals with autism, their families, 
and professionals navigate the resources available in our community. 
At registration on website, short surveys will be required to each participant for collecting demographics and autism 
evaluation data. Resource section of site will store PDFs, videos, and links to various community resources that can 
be accessed by searching categories, topics, or age of child. The system should track and report on resources accessed 
by and data provided by users.
Anticipated Features:
• User account management - Ability for users to log in, create, and manage their profile.
• Users of the application are parents, individuals with autism, professionals, social worker, and administrator.
• Ability to track the pages or types of information accessed by users.
• Notifications sent via email to individuals with autism, parents, professionals, and managers once site 
registration has been completed
• Automated username and password retrieval or reset if account holder has forgot either item.
• A survey system that requires specific questions to be answered to create a user account.
• W3C WAI - The website needs to be disability ready
• Reports generation on demographics and evaluations of users
• Ability to create autism resource pages
• Ability for storing such as PDFs, video, and website link backs to resources
• Ability for searching resources based on topics and categories 
Potential Utility or Impact of the Software:
MS4A staff will use the reports generated from the users experience to improve the organizations activities and prove 
needs of users for grant funding. We also hope the data collected can be used assist with research studies for the 
Northeast Florida autism community
